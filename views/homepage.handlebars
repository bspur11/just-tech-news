{{!-- Your file/folder structure MUST be set up this way for Handlebars.js to work correctly. You will always have a main layout located at (and named) views/layouts/main.handlebars. All other template files will go directly in the views folder (views/welcome.handlebars). --}}

{{!--  two brackets will convert HTML characters to strings --}}
{{!--  Three brackets, on the other hand, will render the data as HTML. --}}

{{!-- Note the use of {{#each}} to begin the loop and /each to define where it ends. Any HTML code in between e.g., the <li> element will be repeated for every item in posts. --}}
